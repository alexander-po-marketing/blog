The goal of this project is to streamline the creation of WordPress blog articles using the Divi Builder by automating the process of applying a consistent design and layout. Currently, we have an exported JSON file of an existing blog article created with Divi Builder and a Word document containing new blog content.

The project involves developing a script or workflow that:

Reads the structure and styling from the exported Divi JSON file.

Replaces the content in the JSON with the text from the Word document.

Generates a new JSON file that preserves all Divi styling, modules, and layout configurations.

This new JSON file should be ready for direct import into Divi Builder, enabling the rapid creation of visually consistent blog posts while minimizing manual formatting work.

Objectives:

Maintain consistent styling and layout across all blog articles.

Automate content transfer from Word documents to Divi JSON format.

Reduce time and effort in preparing blog articles for publishing.

Ensure seamless compatibility with Divi Builder for import and display.

Expected Outcome:
A fully formatted, import-ready Divi JSON file containing the new blog content, replicating the design and structure of existing posts.
